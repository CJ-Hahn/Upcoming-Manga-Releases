# Upcoming-Manga-Releases
As someone who likes to collect the physical volumes of my favorite manga, I often found myself redundantly looking up release dates becasue they just dont release fast enough!
The goal of this application is to allow users to search for their favorite manga, and have an appointment created on their outlook calendars on the given the release date returned by the Google Books API. 
This way I can just check my calendar and not have to search for the same volume's release date 50 times in a 3 month period as I wait!

Note: I started working on this for about a week before realizing it would be best to update my progress on Github, so please excuse the messy update notes included with the files. Going forward I'd like to copy those 
	updates to a new document to clean up the files a bit.
